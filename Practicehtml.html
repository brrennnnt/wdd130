    <h1>The two jewish men joke</h1>
    <h2>One jewish man walks up to another</h2>
    <h2>He asks him for help saying</h2>
    <h2>"I need your advice, my son left to college and came back a Christian"</h2>
    <h2>The second Jewish man replies</h2>
    <h2>"I don't know what to tell you, the exact same thing happened to my son. He left home and came back a Christian"</h2>
    <h2>The first Jewish man says,</h2>
    <h2>"We need to speek with the Rabbi about this."</h2>
    <h2>*The two Jewish men go to the synogogue to speak with the Rabbi*</h2>
    <h2>First Jewish Man:</h2>
    <h2>"Rabbi we need your help, both of our sons left home and came back Christians."</h2>
    <h2>To which the Rabbi replies:</h2>
    <h2>"This must be some kind of pandemic, the same thing happened to my son. We need to pray to God."</h2>
    <h2>The three Jewish men kneel down to offer a prayer to God, to which God replies,"</h2>


    <h1>"You're not going to believe this."</h1>

    <h1> The man who got 3 free beers </h1>
    <h2> A guy walks into a bar and asks for a drink</h2>
    <h2> The bartender gives him his beer and the man tells the bartender,</h2>
    <h2> "I will show you the coolest thing you have ever seen if you give me a free beer."</h2>
    <h2> The bartender replies,</h2>
    <h2> "I'm intrigued, why not?"</h2>
    <h2> The man pulls out a little tiny real life man out of his pocket</h2>
    <h2> The bartender was amazed and gave him a free drink</h2>
    <h2> The man said he'd show him something even better for another free drink</h2>
    <h2> The bartender agreed and the man pulled out a tiny piano for the tiny man to play</h2>
    <h2> Amazed again, the bartender gave the man a second free drink</h2>
    <h2> The man told the bartender a magic Genie created them and for a third free drink the bartender could have a wish</h2>
    <h2> The bartender agreed and wished for a million bucks</h2>
    <h2> Suddenly duck started falling from the sky filling up the bar and surrounding streets</h2>
    <h2> Confused the bartender exclaimed,</h2>
    <h2> "I said a million Bucks not Ducks!"</h2>
    <h2> To which the man replied,</h2>
    <h2> "Well you didn't think I wished for a ten inch pianist did you?"</h2>
