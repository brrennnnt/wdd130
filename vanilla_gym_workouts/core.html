                <h2 class="pcsthree">STEP 3: As you are standing tall and the barbell is up to your chest, jump and shift your weight underneath the barbell resting it on your chest. Step 2-3 should all be done in one motion. This will take lots of practice so do not be discouraged if you don't get it right away. USE LIGHT WEIGHT WHEN STARTING</h2>
