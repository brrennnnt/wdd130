At the campground there will space for trailers and of course tents, pits for campfires, and portable bathrooms nearby. While staying at one of our campgrounds we ask that you always clean up after yourselves. Please leave the campground how you found it or if you are feeling generous leave it even better! Be aware there are bears throughout these woods, so please pick up after yourself.</h2>

                <h2>Not only are there bears, but there are many different types of wildlife in the surrounding forest. Be aware that there are wolves, coyotes, foxes, and of course bears. Along with the wildlife, be aware of insects and plants. Most animals will not bother you if you do not bother them, and if your campsite is free of any trash and food droppings. If you follow proper precautions you will enjoy a great trip with your family and friends!</h2>

                <h2>Always remember the wise words of Smokey the Bear, "Only you can prevent forest fires!" We all know how devastating forest fires can be. Please stay up to date on our current fire restrictions. If you are unsure what they are you can find them on the web and our main facility on site will always have notices posted. Campfires are a great tool when camping. They provide necessary heat, light, a place to tell stories, make memories, and of course to roast marshmallows! They can also be a great danger to our forest, wildlife, and loved ones if the camper does not use caution. And remember, "Only you can prevent forest fires!" </h2>
